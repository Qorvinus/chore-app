# Welcome to my Chore App!

Check out the Chore-App here: [Chore-App](https://protected-eyrie-51452.herokuapp.com")

## What do I do?

I am a web application to help users track allowance and chores completed by their children.  You can setup clients(your children), create your own list of chores, and log them to your children, as well as pay out allowances.

## Summary

After your initial login, you will start by creating clients and then chores.  Most of your tasks will be done on the Home page.  Where you can log chores to clients and payout allowances.  In case you had a typo or would like to change the value of any given chore, you're able to edit them freely without worry of losing data.
